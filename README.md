# Mumbai slum segmentation

More than one billion people live in slums around the world. In some developing
countries, slum residents make up for more than half of the population and lack
reliable sanitation services, clean water, electricity, other basic services. Thus, slum
rehabilitation and improvement is an important global challenge, and a significant
amount of effort and resources have been put into this endeavor. These initiatives
rely heavily on slum mapping and monitoring, and it is essential to have robust
and efficient methods for mapping and monitoring existing slum settlements. In
this work, we introduce an approach to segment and map individual slums from
satellite imagery, leveraging regional convolutional neural networks for instance
segmentation using transfer learning. In addition, we also introduce a method to
perform change detection and monitor slum change over time.
